# Introduction

This repository uses data from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/), a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 
In particular, we will be using the "Hungarian Chickenpox Cases Data Set" which is available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00580/):

**Data Set Information:**

A spatio-temporal dataset of weekly chickenpox (childhood disease) cases from Hungary. The dataset consists of a county-level adjacency matrix and time series of the county-level reported cases between 2005 and 2015. There are 2 specific related tasks: County level case count prediction and nation level case count prediction.

There are 2 specific related tasks:

- County level case count prediction.
- National level case count prediction.
