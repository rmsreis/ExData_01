# Introduction

This repository uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 
In particular, we will be using the "Hungarian Chickenpox Cases Data Set" which is available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00580/):

**Data Set Information:**
