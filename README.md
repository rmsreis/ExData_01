# Introduction

This repository uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 
In particular, we will be using the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set" which is available through the UW CS ftp server:

ftp ftp.cs.wisc.edu

cd math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/WDBC/

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
